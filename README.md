## Codecademy Challenge Project: 
# Build a Website Design System

__Prerequisites:__

_To complete this project, you should have completed the Codecademy lessons covering the CSS box model, 
display and positioning, colors, and typography. You can use more advanced CSS layout concepts 
like flexbox, CSS grid, or responsive design, but they wonʼt be required._

__Project Requirements:__

In this project, youʼll build a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and
designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. 
Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.
As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay 
cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you 
can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.
Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text
styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as youʼd like.
